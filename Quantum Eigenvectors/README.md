# Judging Complex Numerical Methods
Thinking a little bit about how to numerically solve complex-valued PDEs, we can devise a shorthand way of figuring out whether or not the method we’d like to use to solve it will yield nonsense results. Nonsense in this case being defined as: explodes or decays. By making sure that complex-valued PDEs are only solved by unitary operators—regardless of how we discretize space or time—we can weed out many numerical methods that obviously won’t work. This includes all purely implicit or explicit methods. An appendix with an example that matches up well with a simple quantum system, the particle-in-a-box, shows that our line of thinking isn’t entirely ridiculous.
