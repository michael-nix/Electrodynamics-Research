# Where Do Potentials Come From
This paper shows that it's possible to create a numerical model of source charges that are not eternal (i.e. they pop into existence at some time) through a dynamic way of thinking about electric scalar potentials. The electric scalar potential—and thus electric field—created by these charges does not go to infinity at the origin (this is good), but otherwise meets all of the criteria set out by previous experimental, and theoretical treatments (this is also good). This model also forces us to ask interesting questions about how the electric field created by such a charge radiates outward. That is, why don’t charges interact with their own potential, and, "well, what about the magnetic vector potential?"

Due to the way that static .pdf files handle source code control versus how GitHub manages it, the code listed in this repository is more robust and up to date than the code given in the appendices in the paper.
